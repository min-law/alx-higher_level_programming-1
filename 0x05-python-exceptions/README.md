Here for you write a description of the directory but for me let me tell you the steps you're going to use
at first go to alx-higher_level_programming
then create the directory using mkdir 0x05-python-exceptions
then use cat to write your codes
first copy the main.py codes from the alx intanet
then write the code for every tasks that'll show you
and you can check your codes accordingly to alx 
and to check the codes also make them excuatable use chmod u+x file name
or to make all excutable use chmod -R 777 *
